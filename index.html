<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm passionate about learning to code and have been making steady progress on my journey so far. 
    When I'm not exploring new programming concepts, I love taking walks, reading novels, and enjoying lovely mealsâ€”especially when they're paired with delicious milkshakes. 
    I'm excited to keep growing and building new things as I continue my coding adventure!</p>
